# SeaTurtle_DolphinODD
### Overview - purpose
Clear and concise statement of the question or problem that is addressed by the model. 
Who do the more knowledgeable stakeholders (Coastal Tourist that come to Alabama) tend to be regarding the subject of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and Gulf of Mexico sea turtles (e.g. Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), Kemp’s Ridley (Lepidochelys kempii), and Green Sea Turtles (Chelonia mydas)), as predicted by indicators such as demographics (race, gender, education), general attitudes of marine wildlife, motivations of coming to the coast, and willingness to abide by laws?
Who do the stakeholders tend to be that are more willing to change their behavior to reduce negative interactions with dolphins and sea turtles, as predicted by demographics (race, gender, education), general attitudes of marine wildlife, basic knowledge of the laws, and species’ biology, and motivations of coming to the coast?
Who tends to get their information from a given source of interest (e.g. print news, friends and family, social media, among others) as predicted by demographics (race, gender, education), general attitudes of marine wildlife, basic knowledge of the laws and species’ biology, willingness to abide by laws, and motivations of coming to the coast?


The main objective of this agent-based model is to explore and understand the willingness of stakeholders to change their behavior towards common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and Gulf of Mexico sea turtles (e.g. Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), Kemp’s Ridley (Lepidochelys kempii), and Green Sea Turtles (Chelonia mydas)) as predicted by indicators such as demographics (race, gender, education), general attitudes of marine wildlife, motivations of coming to the coast, and willingness to abide by laws.

### Overview - entities, state variables, and scales
## Entities: The model simulates individual people as the agents, these people are ones who go to the coast of Alabama with intentions of recreating, where the demographics of such people are predicted to change in some way (the average age is increasing/decreasing, a larger percent of one race over others, etc.). 
## State variables: Each individual person will have a range of demographics (race: white/ non-white, gender: male/ female, education: less educated/ more educated), knowledge of wildlife laws and behavior/ ecology of wildlife (less knowledgable/ more knowledgable), and motivations for coming to the beach. 
## Scales: The model operates on a temporal scale. Temporally, it simulates that as time passes and variables of the individual change, how will their willingness to change certain behaviors also change?
### Overview - processes
Individuals may vary in their willingness to change certain behaviors predicted by their demographics, 
## Design concepts
# Basic Principles: The model is based on an analysis of human-wildlife interactions with social science.
# Emergence: The model aims to reduce human-wildlife interactions occurring on the coast of Alabama between sea turtles, dolphins, and coastal tourists.
# Adaptation: Agents (individuals) and their willingness to change certain behaviors and how that will develop over time as demographics change.
# Objectives: The primary objective of the individuals is for a transition to certain behaviors that can contribute to the reduction of human-wildlife interaction between people who come to the coast of Alabama to recreate and sea turtles/dolphins.
### Details - initialization
The simulation begins with a defined number of individuals with random demographics and characteristics regarding recreational activities in coastal Alabama. 
Details - input data
As time progresses, demographics are projected to change in a specific way that is related to certain data (e.g. younger people are going to the coast, more educated people are going to the coast, etc.)

### Details - Submodels/functions/subroutines
Stakeholders demographics and: 
Basic knowledge/attitudes
Behavior
Information Sources
Will have a quantified relationship
